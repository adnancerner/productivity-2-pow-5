# Change Environment Variables in windows from commandline

## This is local only, call this from your other batch file to temporarily change the environment variables end get some usage out of it.

## Recommended usage (Windows only!):
 - store the bat file in your scripts folder
 - add the scripts folder in your path
 - use the batch file directly from any directory in command prompt
 - there is a short cut for java (Please edit the jdk locations in the script to reflect the proper installation path, you can grow this script to continue to add more and more versions of java)
